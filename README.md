# Conveyancing CLI

A simple CLI application for conveyancing as a stop-gap measure until the full application has been developed.

## Installation

Open up the 'terminal' application and paste the following into it:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will install the 'brew' MacOS package manager. Brew is a simple and safe way to install and manage programs from the command line.

Next, install Iterm2 using the following command:

```shell
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Iterm2 is a great interactive terminal that can be customized to look and feel the way you want it to.

### Optional

Then set the default shell to ZSH as it is faster than the default BASH shell.

Install ZSH using:

```shell
brew install zsh
```

```shell
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

And follow the instructions [here](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) on how to set a colour scheme!
